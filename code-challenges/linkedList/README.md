# Singly Linked List

A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

There are two types of Linked List - Singly and Doubly. We will be implementing a Singly Linked List in this implementation.



## Challenge

1. Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

2. Within LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.

3. Define a method called `insert` which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the `head` of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

4. Define a method called `includes` which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

5. Define a method called `toString` which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
`"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"`

## Tests

- Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
- Can properly insert into the linked list
- The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
- Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
- Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
- Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
- Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list
