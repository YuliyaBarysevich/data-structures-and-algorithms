# Challenge Class 18

## Summary 

1. Write a function called `FizzBuzzTree` which takes a k-ary tree as an argument.
2. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:
    - If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
    - If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
    - If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
    - If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.

## Tests

1. Can successfully replace the value in a tree with “Fizz” if the value is divisible by 3
2. Can successfully replace the value in a tree with “Buzz” if the value is divisible by 5
3. Can successfully replace the value in a tree with “FizzBuzz” if the value is divisible by 3 and 5
4. Can successfully turn the number into a String if the value is not divisible by 3 or 5
